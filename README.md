# ColorCrypt
ColorCrypt is a steganography project I coded in November 2016. This was the first independent Python project I wrote while I was learning Python. I plan on re-writing the program summer of 2019 goal is to make the code significaly more readable, streamlined and easier to use.

## Steganography
ste·ga·no·graph·y <br/>
Dictionary result for steganography<br/>
/ˌsteɡəˈnäɡrəfi/ <br/>
noun <br/>
the practice of concealing messages or information within other nonsecret text or data.<br/>

## Purpose
ColorCypt is meant to take txt files, hash them with salt, then convert those hashes into png images.

## NOTE
This version of ColorCrypt is out of date and should not be used for securing anything of importance! However, ColorCrypt 2.0 is in development and will now be developed in C rather then Python. It will also feature a whole host of new features to include but not limited to time-based encryption, p2p transfers, and a fun little bit of blockchain tech.
